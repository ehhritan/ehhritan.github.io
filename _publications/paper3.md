excerpt: 'Asbtract: I examine quiet zones—established to alleviate noise pollution at railroad-highway crossings while ensuring public safety—in this study as a natural experiment to assess their impact on accident frequency in the United States. Leveraging highway-rail crossing accident data from the Federal Railroad Administration (1994–2023) and applying difference-in-differences methods with staggered treatment estimators, I find that quiet zones are associated with a 1.27 times higher annual accident rate at railway crossings within these zones. Although vehicle damage costs remain unaffected, quiet zones significantly increase fatalities and injuries. Further analysis using residential property sales data suggests that, even under optimistic benefit estimates, the substantial safety-related costs of quiet zones considerably exceed their benefits. These findings raise important policy questions regarding the safety standards and cost-effectiveness of quiet zones and highlight the potential for new vehicle safety technologies to mitigate grade crossing accidents.'

Asbtract: I examine quiet zones-established to alleviate noise pollution at railroad-highway crossings while ensuring public safety---in this study as a natural experiment to assess their impact on accident frequency in the United States. Utilizing highway-rail crossing accident data from the Federal Railroad Administration between 1994 and 2023 and employing various estimators suitable for difference-in-differences designs with staggered treatment, I find that the establishment of quiet zones is linked to an increased number of accidents. Although no significant effect is observed on the cost of damaged vehicles, the establishment of quiet zones increases fatalities and injuries. This study underscores policy implications, probing the safety standards and cost-effectiveness of quiet zones, and highlights the potential of emerging vehicle safety technology to mitigate grade crossing accidents.
