title: "Ride or Die: Did Ridesharing Services Kill Active and Public Transit? (Joint
with Casey Wichman)"
collection: publications
category: conferences
permalink: /publication/2024-02-17-paper-title-number-4
excerpt: 'Abstract: This study examines the impact of ridesharing services such
as Uber and Lyft on city-level transportation patterns across
the United States. By utilizing data from the National Tran-
sit Database and the American Community Survey, we ana-
lyze changes in ridership and modes of transportation following
the introduction of these services. Employing event-study and
difference-in-differences methodologies, including traditional two-
way fixed effect difference-in-differences (TWFE DID) models and
new staggered estimators, we find that cities with earlier rideshar-
ing launches experience a notable decline in yearly ridership—1.27
times lower compared to cities introduced to these services later.
Our findings consistently demonstrate a significant decrease in the
number of bus and rail trips following the launch of Uber and Lyft,
indicating that these services do not act as complements to other
transportation modes'
