title: "Crimes on the Move: The Effect of Ridesharing Services on Crime"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'Abstract: This study examines the impact of the introduction of ridesharing services like Uber and Lyft on crime rates across U.S. cities, leveraging a natural experiment created by their staggered rollout. Using a Two-way Fixed Effects (TWFE) Difference-in-Differences (DID) model, I find significant reductions in violent crimes, property crimes, and burglary following the entry of these services, while finding no substantial effects on larceny, motor vehicle theft, or arson. The study also investigates the heterogeneity of these effects across different demographic groups, indicating that ridesharing services may influence crime through mechanisms such as employment and demographic changes. This research adds to the limited literature on the relationship between ridesharing services and crime, providing new insights into the potential mechanisms behind these effects.'
