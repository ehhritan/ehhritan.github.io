Welcome to my website! I am a Ph.D. candidate in the School of Economics at the Georgia Institute of Technology, specializing in applied microeconomics. My research lies at the intersection of environmental, urban, and health economics, with current projects examining the impact of ridesharing services on crime, the effects of infrastructure failures on cognitive performance, and the noise-safety tradeoffs of quiet zones at railway crossings.

I will be on the 2024-2025 job market, and you can view my job market paper here.
