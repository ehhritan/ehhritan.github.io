I am a Postdoctoral Scholar in the Department of Health, Society, & Behavior at the Joe C. Wen School of Population and Public Health at the University of California, Irvine. I specialize in applied microeconomics, with research at the intersection of environmental, urban, and health economics. My current projects explore the impact of ridesharing services on crime, the effects of infrastructure failures on cognitive performance, the noise–safety trade-offs of quiet zones at railway crossings, and the role of local elections and hospital privatization in shaping perinatal health outcomes.
